Not doing so is a form of plagiarism.\n\n\nYou MUST NOT use AI to write text for your assignments!\n\n\n\nChallenge\nCreate an account with ChatGPT3.5 (freeversion), Google bard or similar AI.

    "text": "Graphs\nLoad the data (they come with R) then recreate the two graphs by finding code on the internet for the basic graph and building on it.\nLook at this Learning R webpage if you need an introduction or reminder on using ggplot to build graphs in R.\n\nChallenge\nUse this data:\n\ndata(mtcars)\n\nRecreate this graph using the variables miles per gallon mpg, weight wt, displacement disp and automatic or manual am.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\nThis is a scatterplot. The size of the points are weighted by disp. Points are coloured by am.\nThere are many ways to write code to achieve this graph.\nIf something doesn’t work don’t be afraid to look for alternative code.\n\n\nChallenge\nUse the tooth growth dataset:\n\ndata(ToothGrowth)\n\nRecreate this graph using the variable len and dose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\nThis is called a jitter plot with errorbars.\nThe raw data is needed for the jitter part but the mean and standard deviation values are needed for the errorbars. Therefore you may need to summarise the data.\nR sometimes thinks dose is a continuous variable not a factor.\n\n\n\nReflect on using AI\nDid the R code always work first time? Did you or the AI correct it?\nDid you ask the AI to address two problems at once or one at a time and what worked?\nCould you have been more specific in your question?\nDid you give the AI the raw data? Is it a good idea to give your data to AI software?\n\n\n\nCiting AI\nSome norms are emerging for correctly crediting AI.\nOne suggestion is to state in the methods section what part of the work you used AI for, what software was used and what you asked it to do.\nFor example you may write “The R code used to run a power analysis on the chaffinch data was written using artificial intelligence software ChatGPT 3.5 (OpenAI, 2023).\nThe reference would be “OpenAi. 2023. ChatGPT (26 Oct version) [Large language model]. https://chat.opanai.com/chat”\n\n\nSource\nCC Licensed"
